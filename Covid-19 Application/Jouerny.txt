Client:
I had previous knowledge using ReactJS from previous project that I build. 
I used react-spinners to deploy a simple loader while loading data from the database.

Server:
To build a rest API server on Django I watched tutorials on Youtube to learn the basics of Django rest framework.
Also used Django documentation to explore about more complex usings such as writing queries to the database.
